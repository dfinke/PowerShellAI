# v0.5.5

- Added support for GPT-4, conversation-in and message-out
    - Saves the conversation to a file in each invocation
    - Supports changing chat options like the model like `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo` and more
    - List sessions that have been saved, plus you can get their content

**Note**: This defaults to using `gpt-4`. You can set the model to chat with:

```powershell
Get-ChatSessionOptions
Set-ChatSessionOption -model  gpt-3.5-turbo
Get-ChatSessionOptions
```

Getting started example:

```powershell
New-Chat 'respond only in json'
chat 'what are the capitals of Spain, France, and the USA?'
```

```json
{
  "Spain": "Madrid",
  "France": "Paris",
  "USA": "Washington, D.C."
}
