# Getting Started

This is a collection of notebooks that I have created to help teach how to use PowerShellAI about various topics. I have tried to make them as self-contained as possible, so that they can be used as a reference for a particular topic. I have also tried to make them as simple as possible, so that they can be used as a starting point for learning a new topic.

# How to Install

1. Install the latest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. Install the latest [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
